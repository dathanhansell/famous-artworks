# Famous Artworks

Famous Artworks is a full stack web application built with react and express. This project includes a database that keeps track of various elements such as the name of the artist, the title of their masterpiece, when the piece was finished, the artist's country of origin, the specific art style, and where the artwork can currently be found. For the frontend, we use Material UI combined with React, while the backend is supported by Express and SQLite.
